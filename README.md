# nubank
This repository contains files from a project of mine that helps me to control my own spending.

I used https://github.com/andreroggeri/pynubank to get my Nubank account statements.

I probably will use Data Studio to help me visualize the main expenses.

Hopefully, this will help me with budgeting wisely: :)
