# About repository
This repository contains two files that is helping me to access and treat my personal financial data.
I used https://github.com/andreroggeri/pynubank to get my Nubank account statements.
I will probably use Data Studio to help me visualize the main expenses.
Hopefully, this will help me with budgeting wisely :)

# Be mindfull that...
... to use treat_nubank.py you will have to first create a google spreadshit with transaction data. You can do this by uncommenting line 28, running it, and openning 'transactions,xlsx' in Google Sheets.
