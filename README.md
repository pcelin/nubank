# About repository
This repository contains files from a project of mine that helps me to control my own spending.
I used https://github.com/andreroggeri/pynubank to get my Nubank account statements.
I probably will use Data Studio to help me visualize the main expenses.
Hopefully, this will help me with budgeting wisely :)

# Be mindfull that...
... to use treat_nubank.py you will have to first create a google spreadshit. You can do this by uncommenting line 28, running program, and openning 'transactions,xlsx' in Google Sheets.
